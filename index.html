<!-- This is my first web project for the longest time.
    This is a tribute page for Elon Musk. Along this code you will see many comments that I wanted to take note of

<!DOCTYPE html> <!--This tells the interpreter that I'm using HTML5 Doctype-->
<html lang="en"> <!--Not sure why I have this lang="en", maybe it says language is in english-->
<!--
I wanted to implement Bootstrap in this project however there are a few requirements I need in running bootstrap.
1. Add the HTML5 doctype
2. Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first
3. Containers
-->
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8"><!--Please research more about CHARACTER SETS. Satisfies rule #1-->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><!--Search the meta tag as well. Satisfies rule #2-->
  <!--
  width=device-width sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device //PROPER MOBILE RENDERING
  initial-scale=1  part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. //TOUCH ZOOMING
  -->

  Since I don't want to download bootstrap, below are the dependencies needed
